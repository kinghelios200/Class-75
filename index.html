      <p>Pretty good movie for summer time, and it released in summer so, heh free summer point.<br>Summary: Luca, a
        innocent sea monster finds Alberto, sea monster who does whatever he wants since his father is'nt around
        anymore, and they decide to go to the land monster town, or a normal town run by humans, or Portorosso. When
        Luca gets there he is very afraid as he sees people with dead fish and a statue of a person trying to kill a sea
        monster. While he is there he meets Ercole, the villan of the movie, and another caharacter Giulia, who
        "protects" Luca and Alberto when they get into trouble with Ercole's harpoon. They agree to go to a race that
        includes, swiming, pasta eating, and a bike race. Luca does win, but it started raining, so the whole town
        figured out Luca and Alberto were sea monsters, but they get a pass. Giulia needs to go to school, so Luca went
        with her.</p>
